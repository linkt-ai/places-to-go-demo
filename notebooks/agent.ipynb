    "# Agent Development\n",
    "For making the actual itinerary reccomendations, we want to build a conversational agent, which handles querying the formatting a query to the graph database, selecting the most appropriate events based on the user's query and the reccomendation scores, and then writing a helpful output message explaining the logic they used to reach their conclusion. To do this, we will need an agent that requires three iterations per user query:\n",
    "1. **Iteration 1**: Format a Graph DB query based on the user's input. The results of this query should return the top 10 locations of a certain type in a given city.\n",
    "2. **Iteration 2**: Anaylze the results of the graph query, select the 3-5 most appropriate locations/activites to suggest to the user. Format these activities as events, with a `title`, `url`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.\n",
    "3. **Iteration 3**: Review the results of the event generation, format a friendly message to the user explaining the agent's choices and asking for any additional information that might be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general fallback, the agent should not reccomend any activites if the user's query cannot be used to guide a query on the venue graph. In this event, the agent should provide a response in the first iteration, explaining what the user needs to change about their query to provide more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we need to take care of to setup the agent is to create the tool objects that the agent will have access too. This will require writing python functions as well as OpenAI tool definition objects, which should be mapped to the corresponding python function. We will want to create the following tools:\n",
    "1. `venue_query(city: CityName, activity: ActivityType) -> List[VenueResult]`\n",
    "2. `event_formatter(venues: List[VenueResult], start_time: str, end_time: str) -> List[EventObject]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first need to create the custom objects that will be used by these functions, then implement the functions themselves, then finally, create the tool definitions, adhering to the OpenAI tool schema."

The staff greeted us warmly and were attentive throughout our meal. They took the time to explain the menu and offered valuable recommendations, enhancing our overall experience.The highlight, undoubtedly, was the food. The hotpot featured a diverse range of fresh, high-quality ingredients. The broths were flavorful and aromatic, with the spicy option offering a perfect blend of heat and depth. The meats were tender, and the vegetables fresh, complementing the broths wonderfully.\\nHaiting S: very comfortable environment and delicious food. service is so nice. there are so many people here and all enjoy it.

In-house food is plated well, too.The brunch has been great every time I've gotten it--I especially love the kale pancakes!

Honestly, this is probably the best vegan place I've had. And I love meat. The portions are super large. I got the chicken burrito, which if you didn't tell me was vegan I would have believed it. The Tacos Tazon bowl is also massive, you won't leave hungry for sure.I really like the dim lighting inside -- there are some hip hanging lights and light wood all around the restaurant.

He is also a strong believer in the necessity of these types of venues, that help exposed the youth and everyone else to unique and fun musical experience. The show cost me $10 and it was packed in the venue but not as packed as I expected. I will be keeping my ear to the ground for any more upcoming shows.

It was not to my liking, but then again, I have a more western palette. I found everything to be extremely bland and overall odd, bordering on unpleasant. The eggplant dish could gave been so good, but there wasn't enough eggplant and it was so bland and unoriginal. Half a shaker of salt couldn't save it. (Like the way they cut up all the chicken with the little bones and everything. No sides, no nothing. I don't like fighting with my food.

Immediately upon entering, you\\'re enveloped in a special kind of energy...the kind of buzz and excitement where you feel like you\\'re in the presence of something special about to happen. And that something special comes in the form of ricotta toast and seasonal pastas.You\\'ve probably seen the ricotta toast everywhere, and I\\'m here to tell you that YES it tastes as rich and luscious as it looks. The accompanying mushrooms add the perfect amount of acidity, and the perfectly crunchy/chewy toast brings it all together. Pasta-wise, the bucatini was our favorite. The savory nduja paired excellently with the pecorino in the dish that kept on giving. The sheep\\'s milk ricotta occhi is good as well, and the corzetti was simply a fun pasta type we\\'ve never tried before.And my oh my, don\\'t even get me started on the pistachio gelato...BEST pistachio gelato I\\'ve had in my life. If you enjoy a strong pistachio flavor (nut chunks included), you must get this.Go to Misi.

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up the agent, it is clear that the agent needs a more effective way of narrowing down the results, when it writes a query. One possible way to do this would be to setup a vector index. The vector index would be used by the agent to write a natural language query that would return all locations that satisfy the discrete filters and they would be sorted by relevance. To do this, we could embed the reviews of associated with each location. Then, we could create a vector store with each location. The vector store would have the business ID stored in the metadata, along with the city and category (both as indexes). This way, we can first query the vector store, and get a list of general venues that are somewhat inline with what the user is looking for. Once that query has resolved, we will then use the Yelp business ID's of each result, to apply a filter on the query on the graph database. This way, we will be querying over the space of all venues that met a certain similarity score with the user's query and relating that to the space of the user's posts. "
