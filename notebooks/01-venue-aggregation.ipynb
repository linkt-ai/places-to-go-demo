    "As a first step in the Places to Go Demo, we will need static venue data to create reccomendations from. In production, our venue sources will be managed by a Web Scraper bot that will handle crawling social media and updating the list based on activity. For now, we will populate a static set of 2,500 locations, which will be sourced from 5 cities. \n",

    "- **Chicago**\n",

    "1. Gather JSON objects for top 500 locations in each city\n",

    "3. Provide list of ChatGPT and prompt it to create a list of 20 keywords for each archetype\n",
    "4. Design prompt for associating businesses with keywords based on `name` and `categories` field \n",
    "5. Run list of 2,500 businesses and store results in a JSON file."
