    "# Agent Development\n",
    "For making the actual itinerary reccomendations, we want to build a conversational agent, which handles querying the formatting a query to the graph database, selecting the most appropriate events based on the user's query and the reccomendation scores, and then writing a helpful output message explaining the logic they used to reach their conclusion. To do this, we will need an agent that requires three iterations per user query:\n",
    "1. **Iteration 1**: Format a Graph DB query based on the user's input. The results of this query should return the top 10 locations of a certain type in a given city.\n",
    "2. **Iteration 2**: Anaylze the results of the graph query, select the 3-5 most appropriate locations/activites to suggest to the user. Format these activities as events, with a `title`, `url`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.\n",
    "3. **Iteration 3**: Review the results of the event generation, format a friendly message to the user explaining the agent's choices and asking for any additional information that might be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general fallback, the agent should not reccomend any activites if the user's query cannot be used to guide a query on the venue graph. In this event, the agent should provide a response in the first iteration, explaining what the user needs to change about their query to provide more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that we need to take care of to setup the agent is to create the tool objects that the agent will have access too. This will require writing python functions as well as OpenAI tool definition objects, which should be mapped to the corresponding python function. We will want to create the following tools:\n",
    "1. `venue_query(city: CityName, activity: ActivityType) -> List[VenueResult]`\n",
    "2. `event_formatter(venues: List[VenueResult], start_time: str, end_time: str) -> List[EventObject]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first need to create the custom objects that will be used by these functions, then implement the functions themselves, then finally, create the tool definitions, adhering to the OpenAI tool schema."

    "After setting up the agent, it is clear that the agent needs a more effective way of narrowing down the results, when it writes a query. One possible way to do this would be to setup a vector index. The vector index would be used by the agent to write a natural language query that would return all locations that satisfy the discrete filters and they would be sorted by relevance. To do this, we could embed the reviews of associated with each location. Then, we could create a vector store with each location. The vector store would have the business ID stored in the metadata, along with the city and category (both as indexes). This way, we can first query the vector store, and get a list of general venues that are somewhat inline with what the user is looking for. Once that query has resolved, we will then use the Yelp business ID's of each result, to apply a filter on the query on the graph database. This way, we will be querying over the space of all venues that met a certain similarity score with the user's query and relating that to the space of the user's posts. "
